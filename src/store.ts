Game Plot Outline:
Title: Raby's Dilemma
1. Introduction: The young adult meets Raby, who is feeling upset and controlled by its mom. Raby wants to go outside and play, but its mom insists that it stays home to do homework. Raby needs the young adult's help to navigate this difficult situation.
2. Task 1 - Building understanding: The young adult needs to help Raby understand its mom's perspective. They can do this by presenting possible reasons why Raby's mom wants it to do homework. This step will help the young adult empathize with Raby's situation and learn about the importance of understanding different perspectives.
3. Task 2 - Balancing priorities: The young adult must help Raby find a balance between its desire to play outside and the need to complete homework. They can brainstorm together to create a schedule that satisfies both Raby and its mom. This step teaches the young adult about time management and compromise.
4. Task 3 - Communication skills: The young adult should guide Raby on how to effectively communicate with its mom. They can role-play different scenarios to practice assertiveness, active listening, and expressing emotions appropriately. This will help the young adult develop their communication skills, which are essential for coping with daily life situations.
5. Resolution: Raby successfully talks to its mom about its feelings, and they reach a compromise. Raby can play outside for a while before focusing on its homework. The young adult learns valuable coping skills from Raby and realizes the importance of communication, understanding, and balancing priorities.
6. Goal fulfilled: The young adult has helped Raby find a solution to its dilemma and has learned crucial coping skills to apply in their own life.
