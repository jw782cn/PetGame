**Enhancing Addiction Recovery Through a Virtual Pet Mobile App for Young Adults**

## Problem Definition

The primary challenge addressed in this project is the insufficient accessibility and continuity of care for young adult substance abuse patients between the ages of 20-25, who are undergoing treatment at levels 2.5 to 3.1 (according to the ASAM levels of care). This lack of continued support often leads to high relapse rates, as 90% of discharged patients do not receive adequate post-treatment care.

## Product Vision:

Our vision is to develop a mobile app featuring a medical-use virtual pet game that can be utilized during early hospitalization and continue to provide care after discharge. By leveraging a user-friendly interface, engaging storylines, and interactive elements, we aim to promote empathy, self-care awareness, and evidence-based strategies that support patients in their recovery journey.

## Project Idea:

The proposed medical-use virtual pet game will feature captivating content, such as cute pet avatars, that encourage daily patient engagement. The app will enable patients to perform daily self-assessments and decrease the distance between them and their respective clinics. Users will be able to reach out for support easily through the app, as they experience the recovery process alongside their virtual pets. By caring for their virtual pets, patients will develop the skills necessary to care for themselves.

The game will incorporate features such as text-based interactions with the virtual pet, using advanced AI technologies like ChatGPT to create dynamic, personalized conversations. The game will also offer a rewarding and engaging experience that ties in with the patient's reality, helping them develop self-awareness and self-care skills.

We envision our target users dedicating at least 30 minutes daily to the app, engaging in self-assessments and caring for their virtual pets through various in-app actions.

## Game Plot

Upon registering, users will receive a virtual egg, which they will hatch to reveal a cute pet avatar (randomly generated). The pet is unable to fly due to its inability to care for itself. Users will then embark on a journey with their virtual pets, overcoming obstacles and challenges as they grow and learn together. By nurturing their pets with love, users will gradually develop the skills needed to overcome their addiction.

Considerations for Target Audience:
When designing the app and addressing the needs of patients at ASAM levels 2.5 to 3.1, we will carefully consider the specific challenges faced by this group. We will adapt the app's content, user experience, and support mechanisms to cater to their unique requirements, ensuring that the app effectively aids them in their recovery journey.
